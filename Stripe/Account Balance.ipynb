    "At Stripe we keep track of where the money is and move money between bank accounts to make sure their balances are not below some threshold. This is for operational and regulatory reasons, e.g. we should have enough funds to pay out to our users, and we are legally required to separate our users' funds from our own. This interview question is a simplified version of a real-world problem we have here.\n",
