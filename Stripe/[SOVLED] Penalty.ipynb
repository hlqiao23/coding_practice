    "\n",
    "We suspect that we're keeping the store open too long, so we'd like to understand when we *should have* closed the store. For simplicity's sake, we'll talk about when to close the store by talking about how many hours it was open: if our closing time is `2`, that means the store would have been open for two hours and then closed.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's define a \"penalty\": what we want to know is \"how bad would it be if we had closed the store at a given hour?\" For a given log and a given closing time, we compute our penalty like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  +1 penalty for every hour that we're *open* with no customers\n",
    "  +1 penalty for every hour that we're *closed* when customers would have shopped\n",

    "  log:     | N | Y | N | Y |      (one hour without customers while open +\n",
    "  penalty: | * |   |   | * |       one hour with customers after closing)\n",
